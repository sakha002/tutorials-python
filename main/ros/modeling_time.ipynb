    ">An important aspect of using an abstracted time is to be able to manipulate time. In some cases, speeding up, slowing down, or pausing time entirely is important for debugging.\n",

Any change in the time abstraction must be communicated to the other nodes in the graph, but will be subject to normal network communication latency. This inaccuracy is proportional to the latency of communications and also proportional to the increase in the rate at which simulated time advances compared to real time\n",
    "\n",
    "> The final challenge is that the time abstraction must be able to jump backwards in time, a feature that is useful for log file playback. This behavior is similar to a system clock after a negative date change, and requires developers using the time abstraction to make sure their algorithm can deal with the discontinuity. Appropriate APIs must be provided for to the developer API to enable notifications of jumps in time, both forward and backwards.\n",

It might be possible that for their use case a more advanced algorithm would be needed to propagate the simulated time with adequate precision or latency with restricted bandwidth or connectivity. The user will be able to switch out the time source for the instance of their Time object as well as have the ability to override the default for the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the current implementation a TimeSource API will be defined such that it can be overridden in code.
