Printing to console is usually much slower than writing to disk, it is not just leaving the characters in a buffer, but the buffer is limited, and the contents of that buffer need to be moved to the video card (a real text terminal) or drawn on the screen (a graphical terminal) with enough data, the intermediate buffer fills, and the writer process stalls waiting for the output to be drawn. Before making this type of strong statements on performance, actually measure, in a real environment with enough data you will see that yourself.\n","\n","> When you output something to a stream (such as cout), whatever you send is stored in a buffer before it is actually put there (flushed). It happens every now and then, and when the program's execution completes correctly. However, using flush or endl explicitly flushes it.
