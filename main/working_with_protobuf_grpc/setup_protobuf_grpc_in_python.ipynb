(for example in the client code, when the data in placed inside these python classes the proto message is populated and sent to the server, but this seems to be part of the grpc tech, what happens if we only have protobuf?, we still have two apps in each side of the proto data?!)\n","\n","I will put a place holder for all these tree steps to dig more.
