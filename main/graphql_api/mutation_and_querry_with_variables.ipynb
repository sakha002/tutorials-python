    "Okay time for confession. It is embarassing but using and writing queries to our db for a while, I very much was relying on the custom built tools for connecting and passing the querries to graphql. So my focus was mostly on the proper format of the querry, and not much on the API. So much that when searching for 'graphql API in python' (this is what I needed right? some API for qraphql in python?!!), in the results I noticed quite a new name to me \"graphene\". \n",
    "https://graphene-python.org/\n",

    "Well I was pretty sure that was not the name I heared before, it was shorter. \n",
    "Yes It was this 'qgl' library.  \n",
    "https://pypi.org/project/gql/\n",
    "\n",
    "now what is the difference between the two here?\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "okay so ... a qraphQL. client. hmm, it is different than the API, right? how?\n",
    "\n",
    "it says that \n",
    "> Graphene-Python is a library for building GraphQL APIs in Python easily, its main goal is to provide a simple but extendable API for making developers' lives easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay so (I think) it mean that graphene is for builing a graphQL API in python (e.g as a server)\n",
    "\n",
    "So it means that the focus should be on python gql library. and here is the right link finally! https://gql.readthedocs.io/en/v3.0.0a5/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But I guess the reason that I could be this much oblivious, was that once you set up your client, you care mostly on how to get your data from the database.\n",
