# What is the Best Practice (or a good way) to generate documentation and code notes.


I'll need to come to this later!



# Wiki Pages and docs

so the other day I was thinking about having a document like this
in the repo. well it is not certaily the norm.
the professional way is to put it in the code, docstrings, right?
but for someone like me that likes to wramble when working to keep track of my 
disperse thoughts, would that work?
(again I think that failed repo profaneDB can teach me a thing or two in this area.)

Anyways, I guess I couod put this in a docs directory, not important.
but the docs directory is more for code usage and API...
This is more like a blog.

and the drawing page has got too big. begs the question should create multiple files.

can't still clearlt see the value and advantage of wiki pages to in-repo docs.
