    "    - Jekyll is used by the Github. not sure if it is python based or else but seems not that hard to use it.\n",
    "    - I wanted to look into Mkdocs, and there was something like dochub, etc.\n",
    "    - I wanted to look into the material for sphinx which seemed like a nice looking theme. \n",
    "    - I wanted to see if there is a way to convert jupyter notebooks into a docs page.\n",
